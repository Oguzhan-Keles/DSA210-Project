# DSA210-Project
# Apple Health Step Count Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores step count data from the Apple Health application to analyze activity levels during specific periods such as:
- The COVID-19 pandemic
- University final exam weeks
- Other significant personal or public events

The goal is to identify patterns, insights, and potential factors that influence physical activity during these unique periods.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of daily step counts recorded by the Apple Health application. Key features of the data include:
- Date and time of recorded steps
- Total steps per day
- Activity trends over time

### Data Privacy
All data is anonymized and solely used for personal academic purposes.

## Project Idea
The primary focus of this project is to:
1. Understand the variations in step count data across different periods.
2. Visualize trends in physical activity during high-stress or limited-mobility events (e.g., COVID lockdowns).
3. Provide insights into how personal or external factors influence movement behavior.

## Project Plan
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Export and preprocess step count data from the Apple Health app.
   - Categorize periods of interest (e.g., COVID-19, final exam weeks).

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Calculate average, maximum, and minimum step counts for each period.
   - Compare activity levels across selected periods.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Create graphs to illustrate step count trends over time.
   - Highlight significant fluctuations during specific periods.

4. **Reporting**:
   - Summarize findings and insights in a detailed report.
   - Discuss potential reasons for activity level changes.
